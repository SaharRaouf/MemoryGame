## The application

This application used for a study purpose to investigate the effects of using gamification (Progress bar, badges etc.) in digital teaching materials. Therefore, I have chosen to design the website so that it resembles the educational materials used in primary school today.   To achieve this, a combination of the programming languages JavaScript, HTML5 and PHP is used in a Laravel framework that is well suited for developing web pages with browser and platform compatibility.  The application looks like a regular web page with a navigation menu showing all different pages, game and log in option with different permissions, rapports and etc.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
